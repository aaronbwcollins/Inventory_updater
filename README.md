Not much to add here. This is basically an updated version of my older inventory system.
It uses google sheets and a barcode scanner to allow someone to update inventory of their warehouse on the fly.
The format of the spreadsheet needs to be Barcode, Item Name, then Quantity in order to work.
You will need to update the json file path with your own google cloud service account Json file.
You will also need to insure you update the name of the spreadsheet to what ever you want. The name in the code is just 'Inventory'

Enjoy.
